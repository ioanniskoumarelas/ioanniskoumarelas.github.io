    summary: |
      In this course I learned how to use different agentic frameworks, mainly OpenAI, CrewAI, LangGraph, and MCP (Model Context Protocol). With these frameworks we implemented different tools to create a sales representative that sends e-mails, perform our own Deep Research (using Groq), build a Stock Picker, deploy a 4-Agent Engineering-team, and more.

    summary: |
      This was a great course. We experimented with multi-modality, code optimization, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), predicting product prices, fine-tuning of models, and experimented with multi-agent system that searches for product price deals.

    summary: |
      This was a 3-week course.
      
      First week contained a refreshing of the Transformers model and its architecture. Generative AI project lifecycle and the concept of pretraining.

      Second week continues fine-tuning to further include multi-task instruction fine-tuning, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Soft Prompts.

      In the third and final week we dive deeper into Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and how we can use reward model to perform our tuning. Chain-of-thought is then introduced to help with reasoning and planning of models. Finally, the ReAct model is shown that is the back-bone of most agentic AI frameworks where reason and act are interleaved to achieve the desired goal.
